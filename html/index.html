      </div>
      <div class="content-section">
        <p>
          Founded upon owner <span>Brian Slagel’s</span> enduring drive to find
          great bands and get their music out to as many people as possible,
          since 1982 Thunder Records has brought wave after wave of powerful,
          innovative, and often genre-defining music to the ever-hungry
          <span>metal masses.</span> It is this ethos that has seen Thunder
          Records build up a stunning and diverse catalogue, weather the various
          storms facing any independent label, and in an age of declining record
          sales boast the <span>most successful years of its existence</span> as
          it strides into its fourth decade. <br /><br />
          Equally, the label has built a <span>strong reputation</span> for
          nurturing and developing the artists they sign, embracing a mentality
          common to the music industry in the 1970s but sorely absent in recent
          years. Alex Wade, guitarist for Knoxville bruisers
          <span>Whitechapel</span>, appreciates the integrity of the label and
          the down-to-earth approach the staff bring to bear: “I admire how even
          though they are a huge label and have signed some of the
          <span>biggest names in metal</span> that they are still all very
          humble human beings, and they care about seeing the development and
          growth of their artists, which makes such a difference.”

            For over thirty years, Thunder Records has been working with artists
            and producers to make memorable records. We've worked to provide a
            comfortable and professional space for you to create your music.
            Studio A features a grand piano, large floor, and a vintage Trident
            A-Range console for analog tracking. Studio B is an 'as found'
            1970's recording studio plus a newer spacious control room that's
            inspiring and well equipped. Going beyond our dedication to tape
            decks and analog audio, we've equipped both recording rooms with
            Burl Audio converters - gorgeous sound for every track of your
            music. A kitchen and espresso room make an inviting center to the
            building. Look around for a preview of Thunder Records.
            <br /><br />
            The control room features a beautiful and historic Trident A-Range
            console. "13 were made, plus a few small ones for the Vatican", as
            legend goes. We are lucky enough to have #3 here in Seattle. Low
            frequencies down to the earth, high frequencies to heaven, the mic
            preamps and equalizers built into this 1975 gem are a revelation.
            The console is 36 channels, and has been rebuilt from the frame up
            to be fully working and dependable. Thanks Jay! Recording to tape,
            or recording to Protools, plenty of classic outboard gear and a full
            array of microphones make your project more than you had imagined.

            Thunder Records Studio is an actual 1970's recording studio. It's
            almost a time capsule of mirrors, wood, and orange burlap. The sound
            quality is fairly dry but not dead, very warm and clear. This studio
            is ideal for overdubs, full-band tracking, editing, and mixing. The
            piano is a Yamaha U3; or a 1940's Wurlitzer 'Deco' piano, in tune
            and full of character. The room also has a Wurlitzer 200A electric
            piano, and access to Ampeg Fliptop and SVT amps, Fender '68 Twin,
            and other instruments. There are three booths, two with windows and
            one amp-closet, as well as the main wood-floored room. The room has
            a great feel, the floor is sprung slightly, like an old ballroom.
            <br /><br />
            Thunder Records mixing console is an API Legacy 64 input console,
            with Flying Faders automation; it's a beautiful piece, with two
            angled wings to house the high-numbered channels. You can work 100%
            analog here, or use the 64-output Protools rig. We feature Burl
            Audio's gorgeous converters to make Protools sound amazing. We are
            well-known for our collection of vintage outboard gear, and since
            the sprawling patch bay is well laid out, you'll find lots of great
            sounds at hand. Ampex ATR102 Stereo Mix tape deck and MM1200
            16-track analog multitrack can be used, or roll in the Studer A827
            Gold Edition for your session.
